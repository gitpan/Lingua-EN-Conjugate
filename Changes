lots of changes under the hood.  Added the ability to form questions and negations, since 
these are harder to do with conjugated verbs; you've got to switch the word order around 
and so forth.  Also added some new "tenses" ... present_do, past_do, and used_to... these
don't seem to be officially recognized tenses, but they're very commonly used!
