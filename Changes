lots of changes under the hood.  Added the ability to form questions and negations, since 
these are harder to do with conjugated verbs; you've got to switch the word order around 
and so forth.  Also added some new "tenses" ... present_do, past_do, and used_to... I don't 
know whether these are technically "tenses" or not, I'm an engineer, not a linguist!!

added the "allow_contractions" option
